            <p>
                The dataset used is a simple spreadsheet from <a href="https://tuvalabs.com/datasets/dinosaurs/activities">
                Tuva.com</a> containing 28 types of dinosaurs and
                12 attributes: Name, Diet, Group, Hip Type (Lizard or Bird), Teeth, Length (meters), Height (meters),
                Weight (kilos), No of legs used for walking, Continent, Geological Period and Millions of years ago when
                the dinosaur lived.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aim of this project is to visualize this dataset in a clear and intuitive way, ensuring visibility
                and practicality. For visualizing the data, two visualizations are presented. The first one is
                a graph where the dinosaurs are displayed on the X-axis and the height is the Y-axis. In this visualization, the dinosaurs are images and their size are proportionate
                to their actual height and length. The second visualization is a geospatial map used with appropriate colours.
                This shows a map of the world with the corresponding continent of each dinosaur.
            </p>
            <p>
                The questions these two visualizations answer are simple. It allows a user to observe how
                different in size these creatures actually were through a side by side analysis. The second one
                provides a clear understanding of where each dinosaur was situated on the world continents.

                    <p>
                    Given that there are 28 dinosaurs, displaying them all while maintaining clarity and intuitiveness
                    is not straightforward. The chosen approach is to implement a pan and zoom feature. Consequently, when
                    the mouse scrolls on the graph, the x-axis expands, further separating the dinosaurs.
                    Furthermore, when an individual dinosaur is selected, a pop-up graph is displayed.
                    As a result, this shows a side-by-side comparison of the respective dinosaur compared to the height of an
                    average human.
                    <div><b>MAP</b></div>
                    <p>
                    Instead of zooming in, the map allows for clicking on the desired continent or dinosaur,
                    automatically focusing on the element. When a dinosaur is selected, the map zooms out
                    revealing a table containing the extincted animal's main features. Moreover, the chosen
                    extinct animal is expanded and presented below its information. Next, if the dinosaur is pressed again,
                    both zoom and dinosaur return to their previous position.

        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <div>
            <div>
                <h3>GRAPH VISUALIZATION</h3>
                <p>
                    This graph efficiently satisfies the initial aim: Comparing dinosaur sizes. It is not commonly known
                    how tall these animals were in reality, let alone compared to themselves. Usually, individual
                    dinosaurs are weighted up with an average human. Hence, both approaches are present within this visualization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As observed, there is an interesting distinction between comparing dinosaurs themselves and comparing them
                    with humans. By separating these into two graphs, a specific functionality is assigned for each of them.
                    The reason for this lies in the fact that a comparison between a human and one single dinosaur enables a more
                    accurate perception of the actual sizes of each animal than a collective comparison between a human and all the
                    dinosaurs together. This is because, when all the dinosaurs are next to each other, the perception of the sizes
                    can be altered, whereas the one-to-one comparison provides a more precise parallel. As a matter of fact,
                    once a comparison between several animals and a single human is made, the latter appears to be less relevant
                    within the visualization. For instance, an Edmontosaurus might seem small next to a Diplocodocus, but when
                    aligned next to a human, it seems notably bigger. This provides an additional value and utility to the end user,
                    because it gives a different perspective, which the user is more familiar with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, the graph illustrates how unexpectedly huge some dinosaurs are. Similarly, other the dinosaurs
                    are significantly smaller than average. For example, Tyrannosaurus rex are famous for their size and
                    aggressive character. One can observe from the graph that their height is slightly above 5 meters. On the other hand,
                    an Allosaurus, which is not as well known, also appears as mighty as the T-rex, measuring 5 meters precisely. Moreover,
                    those familiar with Jurassic Park, will remember the scene where a young girl feeds a small dinosaur, a Compsognathus,
                    whose minuscule size compared to humans is manifested when it is selected. In fact, the majority of dinosaurs presented
                    in the graph appear in the famous Steven Spielgerg movie. Essentially, this graph can even be used to prove the validity
                    of how these species are presented in the movie. As expected, the similarities are uncanny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, for obtaining a rich graph using images, there are limitations. This project sets the image sizes
                    in accordance to the actual dinosaur size. As such, there is the possibility of having some of the images
                    distorted due to their incapacity to expand without loosing quality. The limitation lies in finding exemplar
                    images for not well known dinosaurs contained in the dataset. Nonetheless, high quality
                    images can be found for those most common dinosaurs.

            <div>
                <h3>MAP VISUALIZATION</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a Kavrayskiy 7 projection, invented by Soviet cartographer Vladimir V. For presenting the continents,
                    it uses a <a href="https://piwodlaiwo.github.io/topojson//world-continents.json"> dataset </a> specific for
                    dealing with continents, the habitat of the dinosaurs contained in the project dataset. The colours are clear
                    enough to distinguish different continents whilst maintaining visible dinosaurs. These extinct animals are placed
                    within a radius of the corresponding continent's center. As such, if a continent contains 4 dinosaurs, they are placed
                    90 (360/4) degrees away from each other. In order to prevent displaying them in a perfect circle, a random value is
                    added to their position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the map, there are several distinctive observations. Firstly, there are no dinosaurs in South America considering
                    that there are none in the dataset. Secondly, the majority are found in North America, compared to South Africa which
                    only displays two and Australia only contains one. Finally and most importantly, each species is not bound to only
                    one continent. For example, Iguanodons are found in North America, South Africa, Europe and Asia. On the other hand,
                    other than Iguanodons, all dinosaurs in Asia are not found anywhere else. It is worth noting how the greater number of
                    dinosaurs in North America are also unique. Those which are not, are typically found across more than one continent. For
                    instance, Allosauruses are not only found in North America, but also in South Africa and Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As observed, when a dinosaur is selected, a table appears containing its main features. Consequently, it can be observed
                    how the heaviest dinosaur is the Camarasaurus, being the tallest. However, a Diplodocus is one meter shorter and weighs
                    half the size. In addition, Dromaeosaurus and Hypsilophodon both are 0.8 meters tall and have similar length. Nevertheless,
                    the former weighs only 15 kilograms whereas the latter weighs 50. Therefore, this proves that there is not necessarily a
                    correlation between size and weight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A limitation to this approach is in the placement and number of dinosaurs. In North America, for example, sometimes a
                    dinosaur is placed on the water (note how the dinosaurs are placed differently on each page refresh). This is due to
                    the positioning of the centroid (computed by d3 geoCentroid's function) being closer to the coast, and the dinosaurs
                    being placed withing a certain limit of the centre. For a dataset with hundreds of dinosaurs, the Map would quickly
                    become unintelligible with too much information, preventing a effective user experience.

        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>
            The process for creating these two visualizations has changed significantly throughout the development of this project.
            One of the greatest challenges was providing a pan and zoom feature in the Graph visualization. Nonetheless, this detail
            is the backbone, which makes the graph so rich and efficient for providing the user with the information they seek. Moreover,
            the main complexity stands in creating a graph where, instead of bars, the domain is a set of images, as well as in applying
            a dynamic x-axis. All this, without losing quality in the images.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the Map, displaying the dinosaurs in a non-clustered manner resulted in a numerous erroneous attempts. Randomly placing
            them was the main alternative, but failed to prevent dinosaurs overlapping. Thus, only the top dinosaur would be selected.
            The final decision involves placing them in a circular radius form the center. However, by simply placing them in a circle,
            it does not seem natural. Hence, a distance threshold was applied on top of this.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, the initial criteria for zooming in on a map was to scroll with the mouse, like in the graph visualization.
            Although this approach was effective for zooming, it came with many problems when zooming back in to the map
            after re-selecting the dinosaur. By clicking on a continent for zooming in and out, it facilitates the interactions the user
            user has to go through. In fact, it offers a swift approach to exploring the capabilities of this visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still, if this project were to be started again, there would be a few aspects worth changing. Firstly, the dataset
            presented a few limitations. Even though it contains the main information for each dinosaur, it is only limited to 28 species.
            This leads to a potential misinterpretation of the visualizations. For instance, assuming there were never any dinosaurs in
            South America, which is not the case. Put simply, if the dataset was extended, the visualizations would prove to be more
            accurate. On the contrary, different graphs would be created because, as mentioned previously, too many dinosaurs would defeat the
            purpose of displaying them in a clear and intuitive style.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, future work could include extensions to the current visualizations. In this way, the graph could potentially include
            a selection feature where multiple dinosaurs are selected to provide a new graph. Examples of such includes a comparison of the millions of
            years ago when these selected dinosaurs existed, or a graph comparing their weight, length and height.

            Similarly, the Map could be extended to contain comparisons of the selected dinosaur with its continent companions. Also, on the dinosaur
            information table, there could be indicators when the chosen dinosaur has the highest/lowest value of a certain feature.
            In other words, both visualizations have numerous future extensions, given the flexibility of their current state.

            For the development of this project, knowledge on creating dynamic graphs and map visualizations were obtained. Still, some inspiration
            was needed in order to satisfy the original aims. For the scroll feature in the graph, the displaying of continents in the map and click-to-zoom
            functionality, three projects helped their completion:
